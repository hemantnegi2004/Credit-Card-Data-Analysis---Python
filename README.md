# Credit-Card-Data-Analysis---Python

Goal: To analyze customer behavior related to credit card usage, including acquisition, spending, and repayment, in order to extract insights on profitability, risk, and engagement trends.

Description:
The project involved exploratory data analysis on credit card customer data across three datasets: acquisition details, spending transactions, and repayment history. The workflow included data cleaning (handling outliers and missing values), merging datasets, and performing aggregations to answer business questions related to customer segmentation, monthly spending/repayment behavior, product popularity, and profitability calculations. The analysis also involved custom visualization and a dynamic Python function that outputs the top customers by repayment, filtered by product and time period (monthly/yearly).

Skills: data cleaning, pandas, data aggregation, data visualization, business analysis, user-defined functions, exploratory data analysis (EDA), conditional logic.

Technology: Python, Jupyter Notebook, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn

Results: Key insights were derived, such as the average monthly spend and repayment, top product categories, highest-spending cities, and most profitable age groups. Visualizations revealed seasonal patterns and trends in air travel and city-based spending. A user-defined function was created to dynamically generate top customer lists by city, product, and time, aiding in targeted marketing and financial planning.
